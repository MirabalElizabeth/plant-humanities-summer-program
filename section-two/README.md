### Introduction

Strawberries have a long history, enjoyed both as a wild fruit and cultivated crop [^1]. Ancient Romans used them medicinally, and Native Americans made strawberry bread. Cultivation began in Europe in the 1300s, with the modern strawberry (*Fragaria × ananassa*) emerging from hybridization in the 18th century.

Strawberries are cultivated by planting certified, disease-free plants in a sunny location with well-drained soil. Proper spacing, soil preparation, and maintenance are crucial for healthy growth and abundant fruit production.

A French spy brought the Chilean strawberry (*Fragaria chiloensis*) from Chile to France in 1714. This species of strawberry had a quality the others lacked: size. It had fewer but larger flowers and gave rise to larger fruit. However, the Chilean strawberry was not hardy and was difficult to grow inland, away from mild coastal climates.

Cultivating strawberries involves careful soil preparation, planting at the correct depth, providing adequate sunlight and water, and managing runners and weeds. Strawberries need well-drained soil, prefer full sun (6-8 hours daily), and benefit from regular fertilization.
