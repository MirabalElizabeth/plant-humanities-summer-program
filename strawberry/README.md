### The Vegetal Textuality of Strawberries

Strawberries (scientific name: *Fragaria*) are plants whose fruits have been valued, consumed, and extensively cultivated. Throughout history, strawberries have been featured in illuminated manuscripts, herbaria, books on the language of flowers, herbals, and various literary works. They are hypervisible, charismatic, and ubiquitous in the human world. This emphasis on the strawberry fruit has led to its objectification, rendering the plant itself unrecognizable.

Across literary history, strawberries have inspired sensual connotations as well as less favorable ones and have even been associated with evil characteristics. As Monica Gagliano, John C. Ryan, and Patr√≠cia Viera have noted, literature has generally been more attentive to the plant world than philosophy and science, despite its appropriations and the biases against the vegetal universe[^1].



Strawberries are cultivated by planting certified, disease-free plants in a sunny location with well-drained soil. Proper spacing, soil preparation, and maintenance are crucial for healthy growth and abundant fruit production.

A French spy brought the Chilean strawberry (*Fragaria chiloensis*) from Chile to France in 1714. This species of strawberry had a quality the others lacked: size. It had fewer but larger flowers and gave rise to larger fruit. However, the Chilean strawberry was not hardy and was difficult to grow inland, away from mild coastal climates.

Cultivating strawberries involves careful soil preparation, planting at the correct depth, providing adequate sunlight and water, and managing runners and weeds. Strawberries need well-drained soil, prefer full sun (6-8 hours daily), and benefit from regular fertilization.
