### The Vegetal Textuality of Strawberries

Strawberries (scientific name: *Fragaria*) are plants whose fruits have been valued, consumed, and extensively cultivated. Throughout history, strawberries have been featured in illuminated manuscripts, herbaria, books on the language of flowers, herbals, and various literary works. They are hypervisible, charismatic, and ubiquitous in the human world. This emphasis on the strawberry fruit has led to its objectification, rendering the plant itself unrecognizable.

Across literary history, strawberries have inspired sensual connotations as well as less favorable ones and have even been associated with evil characteristics. As Monica Gagliano, John C. Ryan, and Patrícia Viera have noted, literature has generally been more attentive to the plant world than philosophy and science, despite its appropriations and the biases against the vegetal universe[^1].There is a long-standing Indigenous and Western tradition of "botanically curious" authors and literary texts that have generated what plant studies scholarship defines as vegetal textuality, in other words, textual works with plant-based themes [^2].

In this section, one of our aims is to explore the different meanings and associations that the strawberry plant holds in literary traditions. While aware that this vegetal textuality is an extrinsic language often imposed on plants, we are also interested in examining how these literary approaches "provide us with insight into the mysteries of plant lives and inspire societies to figure out what a distinctly vegetal form of thinking, being, and acting would be like"[^3].In essence, we aspire to uncover unique qualities, captivating twists, and intriguing paradoxes that have shaped the influential presence of strawberry plants in literature.

The Roman poet Ovid, in his *Metamorphoses*, depicted strawberries as symbols of prosperity during the Golden Age—a time of such abundance that cultivation was unnecessary[^4].This positive view of strawberries takes a notable turn in the poet Virgil’s *Third Eclogue*. In this poem, strawberry plants are portrayed as perilous. Because of their closeness to the ground, they may hide deadly threats, such as vipers[^5].This literary assessment resonates more with the pre-Linnaean botanical classification, which focused on a vertical hierarchy among plants and in which the ones growing near the soil were often regarded as inferior and labeled as vulgar, unhealthy, or even dangerous[^6].

The extrinsic language imposed on the strawberry plant through humanlike projection helps explain why, still in *The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice*, William Shakespeare used Desdemona’s white handkerchief adorned with strawberries as a powerful symbol of infidelity. The silk handkerchief, featuring embroidered spots of strawberries also dyed with pigments extracted from the hearts of mummified maidens, possesses magical powers and serves as Othello’s first gift to his wife. Therefore, it also becomes the false evidence of infidelity that Iago manipulates, ultimately driving Othello to murder Desdemona. As Lawrence J. Ross has argued, the handkerchief is not merely decorated: it is spotted by the strawberries as Desdemona in Othello’s eyes is now also stained[^7].

By the early nineteenth century, we find more cheerful approaches to strawberries. Novels such as Jane Austen’s *Emma* celebrated the popularity of strawberry parties among the upper classes, highlighting the delight they provided as a motive for pastime and outdoor activity. From one of the characters’ perspectives (Mrs. Elton), the Victorian novelist conveys the prominence and centrality that strawberries had attained in the cultural imaginary of the time. Austen underscores that the art of cultivating strawberries served not only as a source of entertainment and solace but also involved considerable physical effort: "Strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of. ‘The best fruit in England—everybody’s favorite—always wholesome (…). Delightful to gather for one’s self—the only way of really enjoying them (…) only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no longer—must go and sit in the shade.’"[^8]

Beyond the Atlantic, the strawberry plant enjoyed its original Ovidian meaning among American transcendental writers, although it still retained erotic connotations. For instance, in Wild Fruits, Henry David Thoreau proclaims that strawberries are "the first blush of a country, its morning red, a sort of ambrosial food that grows only on Olympian soil."[^9] His unwavering focus on a plant, which, assuming an affective reading, qualifies as "so humble that it is an unnoticed carpet,"[^10] emerges among his vast botanical endeavors. He included two specimens of Fragaria virginiana in sequence 44 of the herbarium he compiled between 1850 and 1862 and documented his encounters with the strawberry plant in his diaries during his botanizing sessions on more than one occasion[^11].

Moving beyond a masculine perspective, another American poet, who lacked the public presence of Thoreau at the time—, highlights strawberries as a symbol of the freedom that has been denied to the poem’s feminine lyrical subject. In Emily Dickinson’s poem, the strawberry plants grow over the fence that encloses the garden from which she writes. The lyrical "I" explores the idea of not only crossing that barrier and enjoying the strawberries as an act of triumph and liberation —"I could climb —if I tried, I know—/Berries are nice!"[^12]— but also plays with the idea of a transmutation that would shield her from the social condemnation associated with trespassing: "Oh, dear, — I guess if He were a Boy — He’d — climb — if He could!"[^13]. By humanizing the divine figure of God, Dickinson emphasizes that even the most perfect being would find it impossible to resist the temptation of strawberries and the desire for the independence they inspire.

Dickinson’s deep fascination with the strawberry plant transcended her literary endeavors, blossoming into a vibrant herbarium she nurtured during her time at Amherst Academy, a passion she carried for seven years. The lower left corner of sheet 52 of her herbarium features a specimen of wild strawberry (*Fragaria virginiana*), where Dickinson carefully notes details such as the typical five-petaled flower, displayed both in full bloom and still in bud, as well as the serrated edges of the leaves. Imagining the yellow stamens flourishing between April and May gives us a vision of Dickinson exploring the Amherst woods in springtime. As we appreciate these carefully dried leaves, we may recall the droplets that occasionally form on strawberry leaves. It is not difficult then to portray her admiring the phenomenon known as "guttation," where water is exuded from the tips of leaf blades to relieve internal water pressure.

### Strawberry Beyond the Anglophone and European Spheres

Used for centuries by the Picunche, Huilliche, and Mapuche indigenous peoples of the southernmost regions of the Andes to produce a highly esteemed fermented drink called lahueñe mushca, as well as an abortive substance, *Fragaria chiloensis*, the so-called Chilean strawberry, became known to Iberians in Chile in the mid-sixteenth century[^14]. As the Spanish soldier Alonso González de Nájera recalled, indigenous Chilean populations used strawberry fields as part of their resistance strategies against the foreign forces. In his reminiscences, González de Nájera detailed that they planted the "frutilla" on hillsides and prominent parts of the mountains to attract the conquistadors to the fields and then attack them by surprise as they ate the strawberries[^15].

Strawberries are cultivated by planting certified, disease-free plants in a sunny location with well-drained soil. Proper spacing, soil preparation, and maintenance are crucial for healthy growth and abundant fruit production.

A French spy brought the Chilean strawberry (*Fragaria chiloensis*) from Chile to France in 1714. This species of strawberry had a quality the others lacked: size. It had fewer but larger flowers and gave rise to larger fruit. However, the Chilean strawberry was not hardy and was difficult to grow inland, away from mild coastal climates.

Cultivating strawberries involves careful soil preparation, planting at the correct depth, providing adequate sunlight and water, and managing runners and weeds. Strawberries need well-drained soil, prefer full sun (6-8 hours daily), and benefit from regular fertilization.
