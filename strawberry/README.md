### The Vegetal Textuality of Strawberries

Across literary history, strawberries have inspired sensual connotations as well as less favorable ones and have even been associated with evil characteristics. There is a long-standing Indigenous and Western tradition of "botanically curious" authors that have generated what plant studies scholarship defines as *vegetal textuality*, in other words, textual works with plant-based themes[^1]. In this section, one of our aims is to explore the different meanings and associations that the strawberry plant holds in literary traditions. While aware that this vegetal textuality is an extrinsic language often imposed on plants, we are interested in examining how these literary approaches uncover the intriguing paradoxes that have shaped the influential presence of strawberry plants in literature.

Classical writers have conflicting interpretations of the strawberry plant, ranging from a symbol of prosperity to one of danger. The Roman poet Ovid, in his *Metamorphoses*, depicted strawberries during the Golden Age in such abundance that cultivation was unnecessary[^2].The Ovidian positive view takes a notable turn in the poet Virgil’s *Third Eclogue*, where strawberry plants are portrayed as perilous. Because of their closeness to the ground, they may hide deadly threats, such as vipers [^3].This literary assessment resonates more with the pre-Linnaean botanical classification, which focused on a vertical hierarchy among plants and assumed that the ones growing near the soil were often labeled as vulgar, unhealthy, or even dangerous.[^4].

The negative meaning imposed on the strawberry plant helps explain why, still in The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice*, William Shakespeare used Desdemona’s white handkerchief adorned with strawberries as a powerful symbol of infidelity. The silk handkerchief, featuring embroidered spots of strawberries also dyed with pigments extracted from the hearts of mummified maidens, possesses magical powers and serves as Othello’s first gift to his wife. Therefore, it also becomes the false evidence of adultery that Iago manipulates, ultimately driving Othello to murder Desdemona[^5].

By the early 19th century, we find more cheerful approaches to strawberries. Novels such as Jane Austen’s *Emma* celebrated the popularity of strawberry parties among the upper classes, highlighting the delight they provided as a motive for pastime and outdoor activity. Even when the Victorian novelist underscores that the art of cultivating strawberries served as a source of entertainment and solace, that also involved considerable physical effort:"only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping—glaring sun—tired to death—could bear it no longer—must go and sit in the shade.’"[^6]

Across the Atlantic, the strawberry plant maintained its original Ovidian significance among American transcendental writers, while still retaining erotic connotations that can be juxtaposed with less sexualized interpretations by female writers. For instance, in *Wild Fruits*, Henry David Thoreau proclaims that strawberries are "the first blush of a country, its morning red, a sort of ambrosial food that grows only on Olympian soil."[^7] However, this perspective contrasts with an Emily Dickinson’s poem that highlights strawberries as a symbol of the freedom. In her composition, the strawberry plants grow over the fence that encloses the garden from which the lyrical "I" writes. The poem explores the idea of not only crossing that barrier and enjoying the strawberries as an act of triumph and liberation —"I could climb —if I tried, I know—/Berries are nice!"[^8]— but also plays with the idea of a transmutation that would shield her from the social condemnation associated with trespassing.

Dickinson’s deep fascination with the strawberry plant transcended her literary endeavors, blossoming into a vibrant herbarium she nurtured during her time at Amherst Academy, a passion she carried for seven years. The lower left corner of sheet 52 of her herbarium features a specimen of *Fragaria virginiana*, where Dickinson notes details such as the five-petaled flower, displayed both in full bloom and still in bud, as well as the serrated edges of the leaves. Imagining the yellow stamens flourishing between April and May gives us a vision of Dickinson exploring the Amherst woods in springtime and witnessing the phenomenon known as "guttation," where water is exuded from the tips of leaf blades to relieve internal water pressure.

### Metropolitan Perspectives versus Indigenous Interpretations of Strawberries

While some knowledge and uses of *Fragaria chiloensis* plants among indigenous populations can be found in scattered cases, the information has become decontextualized or hypermediated. This reality has provoked a legacy of transplantation in which we can mostly access their knowledge through European or creole sources. Used for centuries by the Picunche, Huilliche, and Mapuche peoples of the Andes to produce a fermented drink called *lahueñe mushca*, as well as an abortive substance, *Fragaria chiloensis*, the Chilean strawberry, became known to Iberians in Chile in the mid-16th century.[^9] As the Spanish soldier Alonso González de Nájera recalled, indigenous Chilean populations used strawberry fields as part of their resistance strategies against the foreign forces. In his reminiscences, González de Nájera detailed that they planted the "frutilla" on hillsides and prominent parts of the mountains to attract the conquistadors to the fields and then attack them by surprise as they ate the strawberries[^10].

A commercial and extractive spirit permeates the first Iberian and creole descriptions of the strawberry, which differs from the Indigenous affective relationships with the plant. In what may be one of the earliest European textual images of *Fragaria chiloensis*, González de Nájera noted that the fruit was attractive, delicious, fragrant, and healthy. With a keen descriptive eye, he concluded by accentuating their pleasant melting quality in the mouth, mentioning that Indigenous people made wine from them and dried them in the sun to create raisins that were enjoyable to eat [^11].A second reference to Fragaria chiloensis expands the first allusions in González de Nájera’s memoirs. The Chilean-born historian and priest Alonso de Ovalle remarked that these fruits can grow "as large as pears" and revealed that, while they are usually red, there are also white and yellow varieties found on Concepción Island [^12].

Although this strawberry variant was unfamiliar to Europeans, historical evidence indicates that it was already recognized across a broad region of southern America. It is likely that the Picunches had contact with the northern agrarian Inca and may have been the first to bring elite plants from the wild into their home gardens [^13]. In Chapter XI of *Comentarios reales* (1609), titled "De las frutas de árboles mayores," Inca Garcilaso de la Vega refers to a fruit that he calls "chili" that arrived in Cuzco in 1557: "it is very tasty and very attractive; it grows on low plants, almost lying on the ground; it has a ridge at the top, like the ‘madroño’ tree, and is the same size, not round but somewhat elongated in the shape of a heart."[^14] This mention by De la Vega confirms that pre-Columbian populations had a robust association with the plant long before Spanish explorers celebrated it in their writings or French naval officer Captain Amédée François Frézier found the Chilean strawberry in the 18th century.

Frézier’s feat has been retold many times with overtones that border on fiction and obscure the prior knowledge of the fruit by Indigenous peoples. Fascinated by its larger size compared to the smaller *Fragaria vesca*, Frézier transported five plants of this South American strawberry on a six-month sea voyage, an act which led to a prolonged process of experimentation[^15]. In his travel memoirs, *A Voyage to the South-Sea, and along the Coasts of Chili and Peru, in the years 1712, 1713, and 1714*, like the Spaniards, Frézier would compare it in size to walnuts or hens’ eggs[^16]. The only discrepancy between his account and his predecessors’ was that the fruit of the New World was "somewhat less delicious in taste than our wood strawberries[^17]."

Similar dynamics occur within the visual universe of *Fragaria chiloensis*. Even when created by Creole artists, these works often catered to foreign commissions. For instance, at least three of the six 1783 paintings by the Ecuadorian artist Vicente Albán, who was commissioned by José Celestino Mutis, director of the New Granada expedition, feature strawberries. In *Yndio principal de Quito en trage [sic] de gala*, the main character is depicted holding a tray overflowing with strawberries as he reaches for one intending to eat it. Eternalized in this gesture before the degustation of the strawberry, the figure becomes part of a catalog of the richness of the New World and its generative sense of plenitude. Meanwhile, in *Yndia en trage [sic] de gala*, Albán offers the female counterpart to his previous character, still reiterating the existence of strawberries, this time accompanied by other American fruits in a large basket that emulates Demeter’s cornucopia.

Only in *Yapanga de Quito con el trage [sic] que usan esta clase de mugeres [sic] que tratan de agradar*, Albán chooses to depict the strawberry plant growing on the ground. He identifies the plant with the letter "G" and delineates it as "A small tree that produces strawberries, resembling those from Spain but much thicker and sweeter[^18]." As Daniela Bleichmar elucidated, the description indicates that the audience for these works was one unversed in the American products and that Mutis probably commissioned them as a patronage gift for a colonial Iberian institution such as the Natural History Cabinet[19].

The common representation of *Fragaria chiloensis*, which primarily focuses on its exotic appeal and commercial value, as seen in as seen in books and paintings created or commissioned by Europeans, contrasts with the lyrical interpretations offered by Chilean poet Gabriela Mistral, who in her work often sought to reestablish a connection with the Andean and indigenous ancestry of her country. In her poem "La fresa," she invites the reader-lover to show reverence before the strawberry plant: "Do not bruise the earth,/do not squeeze the fragrant one./For her love, lower yourself,/smell her and give her your mouth"[^20]. In this way, Mistral embraces the evocative sensualism of the strawberry, a fruit shaped like a human heart and typically red. Nevertheless, she also demands a vision of the strawberry not as a mere commodity but as a living plant that requires us to bend down and surrender ourselves to its power. In doing so, the poet accentuates the strawberry plant’s inherent ability to seduce, along with its mystery and sense of opacity.

As we have been observing, before the arrival of European colonizers in South America, indigenous populations had an extensive knowledge of and relationship with the strawberry plant. In a similar vein, Indigenous peoples in New England had woven strawberries into their ontology long before the English settlers arrived in North America. For the Iroquois, for example, strawberries are connected to the original creation and are considered a gift from Sky Woman, alongside the three sisters of traditional agriculture: corn, beans, and squash. They are the first fruits of spring and are celebrated annually at the strawberry festival[^21]. The deep link this community has with the plant is palpable not only in their mythology and oral traditions but also in their handicrafts.

The elaborate and delicate Iroquois handbag that you can see here showcases tiny colored beads that depict both the flower and fruit of the strawberry plant. This design illustrates the interaction between the plant and hummingbirds, stressing the relevance of the pollination process. This handiwork validates the diffusion of botanical and ecological knowledge across different types of cultural artifacts. The bag is an aesthetic object that becomes another form of writing and inscription of strawberry plants in the world.

In a different kind of festivity than the 19th-century European strawberry parties, the Connecticut River Powwow Society hosts their annual Strawberry Moon Powwow in late June in Somers, Connecticut. During this celebration, they prepare Strawberry Moon Tea with frozen and fresh strawberries and sassafras and serve it chilled or hotl[^22]. Cherokees believe that strawberries have properties that can help mend lovers’ disagreementsl[^23].

Strawberries evoke relationships rooted in kinship, affection, and emotional connections among North American Indigenous people. Potawatomi writer Robin Wall Kimmerer beautifully expresses this sentiment: "In a way, I was raised by strawberries, fields of them[^24]." In her reflection, Kimmerer imbues strawberry plants with a maternal, protective, and formative role. She further illustrates this connection by recounting the mythic origin story, in which Sky Woman ascends back to the firmament, leaving behind the plants as teachers for her people[^25].This myth allows us to fully appreciate the writer’s intimate relationship with the strawberry plants, which she understands as sources of knowledge, as well as spiritual comfort and safety.

### Between Sensuality and the "Devil’s Fruit": The Paradoxes of the Strawberry Plant    

How is it that a plant often associated with sensuality comes to be known as the "Devil’s Fruit"? To answer this question, we should consider a perceptive observation by Yota Batsaki and Philip Gant: "Plants have many personalities depending on their specific environmental and cultural contexts[^26]". Drawing on the research of anthropologist Dvera I. Saxton, we would like to present the contrast between the positive associations we have examined—such as sensuality and beauty, or the festive spirit linked to the strawberry plant—and the undesirable connotations that it may have for contemporary farmworkers. 
<param ve-image
	   src="wc:Strawberry_gatherers_%281880%29%2C_by_William_Gunning_King.jpg"
	   caption="Strawberry gatherers by William Gunning King, 1880.">
	   
As Saxton shows, picking strawberries requires workers to be stooped over for hours in often toxic and dangerous conditions, leading farmworkers to call them "la fruta del diablo" [the Devil’s fruit] [^27]. Those who work in strawberry fields describe their labor as the most grueling of all. Strawberry plants typically grow to a height of 4 to 5 inches and are cultivated in beds that are 8 to 12 inches off the ground, necessitating that agricultural workers bend over for 10 to 12 hours a day to harvest the fruit[^28].This intense physical strain can lead to a condition known as foot drop, often referred to as "Strawberry Pickers’ Palsy." 
<param ve-image

This serious ailment results from acute compression, traction, or laceration at the fibular head, arising from activities like squatting, casting, or wearing tight boots[^29]. We invite you to reflect on this reality the next time you savor a strawberry. The continuous and unnatural availability of these fruits in the market comes at a significant cost: their cultivators often pay with their physical health.

[^15]:The popularity of *Fragaria chiloensis* became so significant that it began to be incorporated into garden designs well into the 20th century. A notable example can be found at Dumbarton Oaks. In her plant lists for the "Path Edging from the South Gate to the Fountain Terrace of the Orangery" and "The Green Garden," Beatrix Farrand included *Fragaria chiloensis*. In Farrand’s instructions for "Enclosed Gardens," she explained that *Fragaria chiloensis* can only be used in the garden for a limited number of years because "as it is deciduous and the planting of the Garden Green should be evergreen, in order to be attractive throughout the winter when the garden is under frequent observation from the drawing-room windows and from the upper windows of the northeast part of the house." Farrand, Beatrix. *Beatrix Farrand’s Plant Book for Dumbarton Oaks*, ed. Jonathan Kavalier (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 2022), p. 89. *Fragaria chiloensis* is considered an evergreen perennial herb with semi-dormant behavior. Farrand’s confusion may have arisen because the floral behavior of *Fragaria chiloensis* has only been fully studied in recent times. Today, the Gardens and Grounds in Dumbarton Oaks have introduced *Fragaria virginiana* to test as a possible native groundcover, since this is the *Fragaria* species native to the eastern United States (Jonathan Kavalier in correspondence with Elizabeth Mirabal, July 7, 2025).
