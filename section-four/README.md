### Introduction
Strawberries have a long history, enjoyed both as a wild fruit and cultivated crop [^1]. Ancient Romans used them medicinally, and Native Americans made strawberry bread. Cultivation began in Europe in the 1300s, with the modern strawberry (*Fragaria × ananassa*) emerging from hybridization in the 18th century.
